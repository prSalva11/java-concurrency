# Basic Information


### Stateless objects are always thread-safe. 
    Example: A method computes based on all local variables is thread-safe
    
### Thread-safe classes encapsulate any needed synchronization so that clients need not provide their own.

### Update related state variables in a single atomic operation to preserve state consistency. (Check out my Video for examples)
